# README

This repository contains several files that play different roles in our system. Below is a brief introduction to each file:

## 1. data_creater.py:
- **Description:** This script is responsible for converting images into landmark data.
- **Purpose:** It plays a crucial role in the data preprocessing pipeline.

## 2. demo_webcam_smooth.py:
- **Description:** This script allows the real-time display of landmarks on the camera feed.
- **Purpose:** It serves as a demonstration tool to visualize the landmark detection in action.

## 3. knnLandmarkClassifier.py:
- **Description:** This file contains the implementation of a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model for landmark classification.
- **Purpose:** The KNN model is utilized for landmark classification based on the extracted features.

## 4. model folder:
- **Description:** This directory contains the code for training the model using triplet loss.
- **Purpose:** Triplet loss training is employed to enhance the accuracy of landmark classification.

## 5. Feature analysis:
- **Description:** This folder contains code related to feature analysis.
- **Purpose:** Feature analysis is essential for understanding the characteristics of landmarks in the dataset.

## 6. main.py and relative folder:
- **Description:** These files and folders contain the main code for our system as presented.
- **Purpose:** They constitute the core implementation of our system, incorporating various components for effective landmark processing.
